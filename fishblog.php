                                Best Aquarium Fishes for Beginners
                                </h2>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                There are a few lists you need to check before you start your new aquarium hobby. You should start off with a few beginner fishes for which you need to check compatibility of the fishes, hardiness, maintenance (if they are easy to take care of), if they will fit in your tank and their personality that is, if they will be peaceful and get along with other fishes in your tank.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class = "blog1-title">1. Livebearers</h4>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                <b>Guppies</b> – they come in almost every color you can imagine and look astounding. They’re very hardy, easy to take care of and can be kept in tanks as small as 20 to 40 litres. They’re a great community fish and you can keep them in groups of five or more. They breed very fast and hence it is wise to stock guppies of the same sex unless you want otherwise of course. Though they may survive higher or lower levels of pH, the recommended pH range for a guppy tank is between 6.8 and 7.6.
                                </p>

                                <b>Swordtails</b> – They are given this name due to their sword like tails.These fishes are great if you want to keep your plant leaves clean. They’ll also prevent proliferation of algae. They’re peaceful in nature and are great for a community tank. Minimum tank capacity for swordtails should be 100 as they grow large. Their water conditions range from moderately hard to hard although their water conditions are very low. They thrive better in communities, so it’s always better to keep more than one, preferably 5 or more. The optimal water temperature would be between 22-28 degrees Celsius, but they can also do well in cooler, or warmer tanks.

                                </p>
                                <h4 class = "blog1-title">2. Betta </h4>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                This is one of the disputable fishes. The bettas are great to look at, their fin types are breathtaking and they can live in a community tank, but the conditions required might be a little confusing for a novice aquarist. It’s a good idea to keep a betta alone for a beginner, making sure his tank is at least 20 litres. They are easy to keep because they breathe from the surface. They may get territorial in a small tank, so a big tank is preferable if you’re planning on keeping them with other fishes. Just make sure to change the water on a regular basis and keep them at the right temperature (22-28 degree Celsius).
                                </p>
                                <h4 class = "blog1-title">3. Goldfish </h4>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                This is a very notable fish with a gorgeous golden-orange color with fanned tails that everyone’s heard of or seen. They can be very easy to care for with a little research for beginners. Typically, you should give them 30 litres per fish and change 30% of water each week as they are nasty eaters. These fish prefer temperatures between 16-23 degrees Celsius. They can easily grow up to 4-6 in a year and upto 14 inches over the years.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class = "blog1-title">4. Angelfish </h4>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                Angelfish are generally equanimous, although they can become territorial if there is inadequate space for them to live happily. It is a regal fish but does not thrive in a small tank. You need a tank of at least 100 litres to keep an angelfish and it’s always better to use a tank that is 16 inches high or higher. Make sure you provide plants and other hiding places. They’re very hardy and easy to keep. They’re a cichlid so they might prey on very small fish but in general they make an apposite community fish. Typically, the water temperature should be 24 to 28 degrees Celsius.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class = "blog1-title">5. Gourami  </h4>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                The gouramis are easy to take care of and can be kept in tanks of at least 100 litres and they require space at the top of the tank so they can breath air. They are undemanding and therefore are well suited to most community aquariums. They’re very hardy and can adapt to tough water parameters. Pearl gouramis would be an apt choice for beginners although they do not like thriving with fishes of aggressive demeanor. Moonlight gourami is also suitable for beginners.
                                </p>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                There are lot of other fishes which are good beginners fish but we have chosen the above fishes as they are easily available (except a few) in the local fish shop, also known as LFS, and they are pocket friendly too.
